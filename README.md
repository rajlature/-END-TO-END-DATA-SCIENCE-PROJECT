*DOMAIN * : DATA SCIENCE

DURATION : 6 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:-

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data science pipeline built around real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. It integrates state-of-the-art deep learning with a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, making advanced computer vision technology accessible through a simple web app. The goal is to allow users to upload an image and instantly detect and label objects within it — all in a matter of seconds.
We utilize the YOLOv8n (nano) variant from Ultralytics, which is a lightweight and fast pre-trained object detection model capable of detecting a wide range of common object classes with high accuracy. YOLO stands for "You Only Look Once," and it is widely used in real-world applications for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects in images or video streams.
To make the application easy to use and demonstrate in a browser, we integrate the model with Streamlit, an open-source Python framework designed for building interactive web apps for data science and machine learning. Users can drag and drop or upload an image, and the backend model performs detection and displays the output image with bounding boxes and class labels in real time.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Python – Main programming language for the entire project.
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) – Pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
Streamlit – For building the interactive frontend/web app.
OpenCV – For image reading, processing, and handling.
Pillow (PIL) – To support image manipulation and conversions.
NumPy – For array operations and image data handling.
VS Code / Jupyter Notebook – For development and experimentation.
pip / virtualenv – To manage dependencies and isolate environments.
Usefulness & Applications:
This project has practical use in multiple domains:
Retail Stores / Supermarkets – Monitor shelves to detect missing products and automate inventory updates.
Warehouses / Smart Logistics – Real-time object detection can help count or track items for warehouse automation.
Traffic Monitoring – Detect and count vehicles, people, or objects in traffic feeds for smart city planning.
Surveillance & Security – Automatically identify unusual activity or track objects in security camera footage.
Education & Research – A great demonstration of computer vision in action for students and researchers learning about deep learning.
E-commerce – Automatically tag products in images or verify package contents before shipping.
Who It Is Useful For:
Students – To understand how to connect AI models with real-time web applications.
Data Scientists & ML Engineers – As a base framework to deploy and visualize object detection models.
Retailers & Inventory Managers – Who want simple tools for monitoring products visually.
Developers – Looking to build smarter apps with image understanding and AI.
Startups – Needing a prototype for AI-powered visual systems.
Conclusion:
This project highlights how deep learning models can be effectively deployed and showcased using modern, lightweight web technologies. It combines machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack deployment — giving users a complete hands-on experience from model loading to real-world usage. With slight modifications, the system can be extended for webcam feeds, live video detection, database logging, or cloud deployment, making it highly scalable for real-time smart solutions.
